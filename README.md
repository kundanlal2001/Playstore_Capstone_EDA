Analyzing the Data of Playstore topic in Capstone Project

We chose to do a data analysis on a Play store data set and a User Review as part of the same study for two reasons. First, we wanted to do data driven findings on a subject that most people can relate to as real world analysis, and second, there were a lot of numeric data parts related to this Play store dataset.
We dealt with 10840+ rows & 13 columns of data in which there were around 10840+ apps categorized under 21 categories ..,

Our goal was to discover answers to many questions using Python (Pandas) chart analysis, which may be extremely useful to every Android application development firm in understanding what the market requires and what sort of or category/genre of applications they can go for as their product.
We employed several types of diagrams in charts depending on the amount of the samples and their representation, such as a bar chart, a pie chart, a barh chart, a scatter chart, and so on.

It was difficult to plot all of the samples since there were so many of them, so we had to arrange them by category and use bar or barh graphs in several instances.
Many conclusions were made about the most installed applications, one of most installed categories of apps, the link between genres of apps and its content rating, if the size of an app has an influence on the number of installations, what sort of apps users are primarily paying for, and so on.
We attempted to discover correlations between most of the columns as much as feasible. so that a comprehensive perspective of the findings may be provided and appropriate recommendations can be made...
